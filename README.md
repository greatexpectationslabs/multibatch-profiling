# multibatch-profiling
Test repo for experimental multibatch profiling

### Setup

For now, this demo is built off an experimental branch (`experimental/multibatch-profiling`) on this public fork of Great Expectations: `https://github.com/abegong/great_expectations-1`.

Later, we may want to bring this example notebook into GE itself.

For now, setup is:
1. clone this repo: `https://github.com/abegong/great_expectations-1`
2. navigate to this branch: `experimental/multibatch-profiling`
3. install great_expectations : `pip install -e .`
4. from this directory, run `jupyter lab` to launch the notebook.
